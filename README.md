### A Blank Window
i3Void is a blank window for usage in the i3 window manager.

A blank window? Well not exactly... When you activate the i3void window you are presented with two buttons to Close or change the background color.


### i3 Keyboard Shortcut

Add the following to the i3 config file to run i3void.

> bindsym $mod+w exec python <path_to_i3void>/i3void/i3void.py

I have it mapped to $mod+w, but you can change it to your preferred key.
